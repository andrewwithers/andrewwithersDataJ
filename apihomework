Q: The New York Times used a version of this API to do this interactive about the sequence of votes leading up to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. How would you use the API to get the information about these votes? Hint: The votes were on April 6/7, 2017.
A: Search by those dates (https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/senate/votes/2017-04-06/2017-04-07.json) or by roll call (https://api.propublica.org/congress v1/senate/80-115/sessions/1/votes/111.json)
