So when I first messing around on the WNYC Data Team's git page, one of the very first things I noticed was the thermal heatmap of lower Manhatten that they have set as their AVI. I scrolled through and figured their 'harlem-heat' repository could be a good bet for where that graphic originated.

Although searching through the repository and the linked finished stories didn't turn up this particular graphic, I did find an amazingly cool breakdown of how the WNYC team built sensors, teamed with local ambassadors to have the sensors placed in A/C-less Harlem apartments, wrote a script to have the sensors *wake up* and collect and transmit temperature data every 15 minutes, and then visualized the data in some cool ways. Honestly just a really cool project from start to finish in terms of setting out to create a powerful database, then teasing out a powerful story.

The interesting bits in the code itself were the parts that remotely communicated with the sensor. The "wake up" and "go back to sleep" parts were fascinating. It is interesting to see this sort of coding for custom-built sensors and very cool to imagine the applications. For some reason the small sensor they used sort of reminded me of a Raspberry Pi unit that I messed around with briefly in high school.
